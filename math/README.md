## Math Bot

This is a bot that moderates a simple math question and answer session between two players. The bot is composed of two main methods:
* `on_command`: Provides interface for users to create and answer math questions.
* `on_new_task_room`: Waits for a new task room to be created and joins the room as bot.

The token has to be linked to a permissions entry that gives the bot at least the following rights: `api`, `send_message`, `send_privately`.
Users assigned to this task need at least the rights: `send_command`
Please refer to [the documentation](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_multibots.html) for more detailed information.


## Setting up and running

### Setup 

1. Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). You might also need the [jq package](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) too. 
2. Clone the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) repository.
3. Before running the bot, several environmental variables would need to be generated and assigned. This process is detailed in the [documentation](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html), which details both the general preparation and the [bot specific initialisations](https://clp-research.github.io/slurk/slurk_gettingstarted.html#chatting-with-a-bot). The bot also needs to have specific permissions, listed below this paragraph. The above permissions can be found in [this example permissions file](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/blob/master/math/math_bot_permissions.json) already.  
    ```
    {
        "api": true,
        "send_message": true,
        "send_privately": true,
        "send_html_message": true
    }
    ```
    **To skip all this setup above, you could run a [setup script](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/blob/master/math/setup.sh).** 
    1. Make sure that the [slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) and slurk-bots repositories live next to each other on the same level.
    2. Navigate to the base directory of this repository and run the script to launch this bot, your command should look like ```bash math/setup.sh``` 
    This script will build and run the docker images, it will initialise all the env variables with the right permissions and it will set up two bots that can talk to each other locally on your computer. The bot will appear in your containers list as ```slurk/math-bot```. At the end of the run there will be two tokens printed in the shell that you will need to paste to access the waiting rooms. 
4. Save the generated tokens!

Note: Every time a new terminal session is started, the env variables will need to be set up again. You can just run the script again. 
    
### Running and playing the bot

If you have everything already set up, you can run the bot using the following command (take notice of the right env variable names):    
```bash
docker run -e SLURK_TOKEN=$MATH_BOT_TOKEN -e SLURK_USER=$MATH_BOT -e MATH_TASK_ID=$TASK_ID -e SLURK_PORT=5000 --net="host" slurk/math-bot &
```

To access the waiting rooms, you will need to input the saved tokes as well as any string as username. If you ran the setup script, there will be two tokens towards the end that will look something like below.
