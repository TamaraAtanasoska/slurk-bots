# slurk-bots
Bots for the [Slurk](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk) project.

Inside each folder you will find a bot with the instructions to run it locally on your machine.  
If you want to write your own bot and are looking for a good place to start, take a look at the [echo bot](https://github.com/clp-research/slurk-bots/tree/master/echo)
